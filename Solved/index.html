    <hr>
    <p>There is a clear correlation between yearly cost of food per capita in the world and the GDP PPP per capita, both variables highly correlate to the decrease in deaths per million in the world. We can infer that  average world hunger could be measured by GDP per capita and a change in trend will revert reduction trend of hunger deaths.

    <p> This graphs indicates a clear downward trend on the deaths per million given the increase in food compsuption per person. As it is expected world will stagnate and stop its income increase trend we can expect a curve on the trend for at least 3 years.
